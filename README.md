# Asteroid-Attack

A 10 second shooting game consisting of three classes: a player, meteors, and bullets. 

100 Meteors fall from the top of the screen and the player (located at bottom of screen) can continiously fire bullets and move left and right.

The player has 10 seconds to shoot atleast 50 meteors to save Planet Earth. 

Failure to shoot atleast 50 meteors results in game lost

To run the game: 

X: start game 

Spacebar: Shoot bullets 

Arduino joystick: move left and right.

Had issues with joystick so player has to use "A" and "D" key to move left and right
